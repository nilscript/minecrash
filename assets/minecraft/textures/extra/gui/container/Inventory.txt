Use Paint.Net

For all the big inventory stuff
Use 2 Layers
First layer for the background
Paint the bakground with the three first colours
On background (not the black corner) use Add Noise (Intensity 15, Color Saturation 0 and Coverage 100) and Motion Blur (Angle: 0, Centred: check and Distance: 2)

Secound layer for the foreground
Paint the foreground with the three last colours
On foreground (not the black corner) use Add Noise (Intensity 10, Color Saturation 0 and Coverage 100) and Glow (Radius: 8, Brightness: -46 and Contrast: 14) and remember to remove any outstanding glow effect

For Buttons and other use Add Noise (Intensity 8, Color Saturation 0 and Coverage 100)
